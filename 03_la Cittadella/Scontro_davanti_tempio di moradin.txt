DARKLIGHT ORE
Darklight ore is a rare and dangerous substance found in the
Underdark. It occurs only in formations of heavy metal ore. A
darklight lode’s inherent properties cause it to give off a milky,
purple glow that is equal to a torch for the purpose of illumina-
tion. However, this radiation is poisonous. Of all the Underdark
races, only the drow have been known to mine the ore and har-
ness its power, using lead-shielded equipment.
Anyone who comes within 60 feet of a darklight lode without
appropriate armor or shielding (such as that provided by a
stone wall) is immediately exposed to darklight poisoning. For
all purposes, darklight poisoning functions as regular poison.
The Fortitude save to resist darklight poisoning is DC 18. The
initial effect is 1d6 points of Constitution damage. The second-
ary effect is a disease that is similar to mummy rot. However,
this disease is not magical, so a paladin’s divine health and a
monk’s purity of body allow those characters to resist its effect.
Furthermore, a victim who dies of darklight poisoning does not
shrivel into dust. A caster level check is required for a healing
spell to work on a victim of darklight poisoning, but this limita-
tion is overcome by a neutralize poison spell rather than break
enchantment or remove curse.
Some sages have theorized a connection between darklight
ore radiation and the existence of the mutated fungus com-
monly known as violet fungus. No link has been proven yet,
but violet fungus appears to be impervious to the effect of the
radiation
