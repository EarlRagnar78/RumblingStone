[]{#anchor}**Ring of Chaotic Illumination**

[]{#anchor-1}**Physical Description**

The ring appears as a circle of obsidian pulsing with an inner violet
light. When touched by a chaotic warlock, infernal inscriptions manifest
on its surface, reading *\"True power comes from Chaos\"* in Infernal
script. To all others, it appears as a simple cobalt blue aquamarine
ring with subtle shifting patterns.

[]{#anchor-2}**Known History**

During the Era of Torments, when the gods walked Toril, this ring was
forged in the midst of a crucial battle between divine forces. Centuries
later, it was recovered by a powerful Netherese mage, Vess\'ith
Shadowweaver, and retained part of its original divine power.
