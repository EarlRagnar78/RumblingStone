<p><b>Aberration
 (Ex)
</b> Gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.</p>
<p><b>Archery Combat Style
</b> The Ranger has chosen to specialise in Archery</p>
<p><b>Bonus Feats
</b> a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat at 1st, 2nd and every two fighter levels thereafter</p>
<p><b>Combat Style
 (Ex)
</b> At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character&#39;s class features but does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any way. If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. The benefits of the ranger&#39;s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p><b>Darkvision
 (Ex)
</b> Range 60 ft.; Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.</p>
<p><b>Dwarf Racial Traits
 (Ex)
</b> <p>Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet with Darkvision. </p>
<p>Dwarves treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons. </p>
<p>Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn&#39;t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. </p>
<p>Stability: +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing firmly on the ground. </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects </p>
<p>+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids </p>
<p>+4 Dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items. </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.</p></p>
<p><b>Endurance
</b> A ranger gains Endurance (see page 93) as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
<p><b>Favored Enemy
 (Ex)
</b> At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table 3-14: Ranger Favored Enemies. Due to his extensive study on his chosen type of foe and training in the proper techniques for combating such creatures, the ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. For example, a 5th-level ranger has two favored enemies; against one he gains a +4 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks and weapon damage rolls, and against the other he has a +2 bonus. At 10th level, he has three favored enemies, and he gains an additional +2 bonus, which he can allocate to the bonus against any one of his three favored enemies. Thus, his bonuses could be either +4, +4, +2 or +6, +2, +2. If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy (for instance, devils are both evil outsiders and lawful outsiders), the ranger&#39;s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher. See the Monster Manual for more information on types of creatures.</p>
<p><b>Humanoid Type
</b> </p>
<p><b>Stone warden
 (Ex)
</b> Beginning at 2nd level, a deepwarden knows how to use his strengths to compensate for his weaknesses. He adds his Constitution bonus to AC instead of his Dexterity, if the character&#39;s Constitution bonus is higher. The deepwarden loses this bonus to his Armor Class whenever he would normally be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC. In such a situation, the deepwarden would still be considered flat-footed.</p>
<p><b>Track
</b> A deepwarden gains Track as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><b>Track
</b> A ranger gains Track (see page 101) as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><b>Trap Sense
 (Ex)
</b> A dungeon delver is adept at evading the effects of traps. See the barbarian class feature, page 26 of the Player&#39;s Handbook. The bonuses rise by 1 for every three additional dungeon delver levels gained (+2 at 4th level, +3 at 7th level, and +4 at 10th level) and stack with similar bonuses granted by other classes.</p>
<p><b>Trap Sense
</b> Character has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Deepwardens are proficient with all types of simple and martial weapons,all types of armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> A fighter is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields).</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><b>Wild Empathy
 (Ex)
</b> A ranger can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a bear or a monitor lizard). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see page 72). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. to use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (such as a basilisk or a girallon), but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
