Let's break down the CR and XP for this revised encounter, factoring in the specific villain statistics and the staged nature of the battle. We'll also calculate the treasure, incorporating the villains' gear.

### Encounter Level (EL) Calculation

The EL calculation involves summing the Adjusted XP (AXP) of all monsters involved in the encounter and then finding the EL that corresponds to that total AXP.

**Villain CRs:**
*   **Belkram, Drow-Corrupted:** CR 13
*   **Corrupted Fiendish Dire Worg:** CR 10
*   **Half-Illithid Urialle:** CR 14
*   **Half-Illithid Yochlol (2):** CR 11 each

**1. Calculate Base XP for each creature:**

*   Belkram (CR 13): 19,000 XP
*   Worg (CR 10): 9,000 XP
*   Urialle (CR 14): 25,000 XP
*   Yochlol 1 (CR 11): 12,000 XP
*   Yochlol 2 (CR 11): 12,000 XP

**2. Sum the Base XP:**
Total Base XP = 19,000 + 9,000 + 25,000 + 12,000 + 12,000 = **77,000 XP**

**3. Adjust for Multiple Monsters:**
The DMG (pg. 49) provides multipliers for multiple monsters. In this case, there are 5 monsters.
*   5 monsters = x2.5 multiplier

**4. Calculate Adjusted XP (AXP):**
AXP = Total Base XP x Multiplier
AXP = 77,000 XP x 2.5 = **192,500 XP**

**5. Determine Encounter Level (EL) from AXP:**
Consulting the D&D 3.5 DMG (pg. 49) chart for AXP values:
*   EL 14: 110,000 AXP
*   EL 15: 165,000 AXP
*   EL 16: 220,000 AXP

Since 192,500 AXP falls between EL 15 and EL 16, this encounter is an **EL 15.5**, which we round up to **EL 16**.

**EL Conclusion:** This is a **Challenging (EL 16)** encounter for a party of four 13th-level characters. The staged nature of the fight helps manage the threat, as the party won't face all opponents simultaneously from the start.

### Experience Points (XP) for the Party

The XP awarded to the party is the *Adjusted XP* calculated above, divided by the number of party members.

*   Total AXP: 192,500 XP
*   Number of Players: 4

*   XP per Player = 192,500 XP / 4 = **48,125 XP per player**

### Treasure Calculation

Treasure is typically based on the EL of the encounter. For an EL 16 encounter, the DMG (pg. 52) suggests a standard treasure value.

**Standard Treasure for EL 16:** 52,000 gp (this is the value of items, not raw gp).

This value should be distributed among goods (coins, gems, art objects), minor magic items, medium magic items, and major magic items. The villains' gear counts towards this total.

Let's itemize the villains' significant magic items and other valuables:

**Belkram's Possessions:**
*   *+3 full plate*: 17,650 gp
*   *+3 vicious unholy maul*: 18,300 gp (+3 enhancement, +2 vicious, +2 unholy, +1 flaming)
    *   *Note: +2 vicious (4,000 gp), +2 unholy (8,000 gp), +1 flaming (2,000 gp) on a +3 maul (18,000 gp base for +3 weapon, 18,300 gp for maul). The total price for the weapon is calculated as +3 (18,000 gp) + Vicious (4,000 gp) + Unholy (8,000 gp) + Flaming (2,000 gp) = 32,000 gp equivalent for a +5 weapon. So the actual cost is 25,000 gp (for a +5 equivalent) plus the base maul. A +3 weapon is 18,000 gp. A +5 equivalent weapon is 50,000 gp. Let's recalculate this as a +5 equivalent weapon as the enchantments are +2 vicious (+4 bonus), +2 unholy (+2 bonus), +1 flaming (+1 bonus) = +7 equivalent. This is a very powerful weapon.*
    *   *Correction for weapon enchantment value:* The "vicious" property is a +2 equivalent, "unholy" is a +2 equivalent, "flaming" is a +1 equivalent. This is a total of +5 in special abilities. Added to the +3 enhancement bonus, this weapon is a **+8 equivalent** weapon. A +8 equivalent weapon costs **98,000 gp**. (This is significant and accounts for a large portion of the treasure!)
*   *Belt of giant strength +4*: 16,000 gp
*   *Cloak of charisma +2*: 4,000 gp
*   *Periapt of wisdom +4*: 16,000 gp
*   **Adamantine Crown:** This is the artifact they are seeking, so its value is plot-dependent. It could be priceless, or have a market value as a *minor artifact* (e.g., 50,000 gp to 100,000 gp if it has magical properties beyond being just adamantine). If it's merely a masterwork adamantine crown, it might be worth 3,000-5,000 gp in materials. Let's assume it's a minor artifact for now at **75,000 gp (plot-dependent value)**.
*   Scroll of *divine power*: 700 gp (7th level caster, 4th level spell)

**Urialle's Possessions:**
*   *+2 anarchic two-bladed sword*: 18,300 gp (+2 enhancement +2 anarchic property = +4 equivalent. A +4 weapon is 32,000 gp, plus the weapon cost.) Let's calculate as a +4 equivalent: **32,000 gp**.
*   *+1 half-plate*: 1,750 gp

**Total Identified Magic Items Value:**
*   Belkram's Gear:
    *   Full Plate: 17,650 gp
    *   Maul: 98,000 gp (this is a major item)
    *   Belt: 16,000 gp
    *   Cloak: 4,000 gp
    *   Periapt: 16,000 gp
    *   Scroll: 700 gp
    *   Adamantine Crown: 75,000 gp (assuming minor artifact)
*   Urialle's Gear:
    *   Two-bladed sword: 32,000 gp
    *   Half-plate: 1,750 gp

**Total from Villains' Personal Gear = 17,650 + 98,000 + 16,000 + 4,000 + 16,000 + 700 + 75,000 + 32,000 + 1,750 = 261,100 gp.**

This is *significantly higher* than the suggested 52,000 gp for an EL 16 encounter. This means the villains are exceptionally well-equipped, which is appropriate for epic-level foes.

**Recommendation for Treasure Distribution:**

Given the high value of the villains' personal gear, you might adjust the "background" treasure of the tomb.

1.  **Villain Gear:** The *+3 vicious unholy maul* is an *extremely* powerful weapon, potentially too good for a 13th-level party, especially if a good-aligned character tries to wield it (it deals 1d6 vile damage to good users, plus the 1d6 vile from 'vicious'). Consider having it break, be too evil to attune to, or require special cleansing. The Adamantine Crown is a quest item, not usually part of disposable treasure.

2.  **Raw Coin/Gems/Art:** You could reduce the amount of loose gold, gems, and art objects found in the desecrated shrine, perhaps to only 10-20% of the standard EL 16 value (e.g., 5,000-10,000 gp in assorted coins, a few low-value gems or desecrated art objects).

3.  **Other Magic Items:** The *belt, cloak, periapt*, and *+2 anarchic two-bladed sword* are good finds. The *+3 full plate* is also solid.

**Final Treasure Summary:**

*   **Plot Item:** Adamantine Crown (value 75,000 gp for calculation, but functions as a quest reward).
*   **Major Magic Items:**
    *   *+3 vicious unholy maul* (98,000 gp - potentially cursed or difficult to use/cleanse)
    *   *Periapt of wisdom +4* (16,000 gp)
    *   *Belt of giant strength +4* (16,000 gp)
    *   *+2 anarchic two-bladed sword* (32,000 gp)
*   **Medium Magic Items:**
    *   *+3 full plate* (17,650 gp)
*   **Minor Magic Items:**
    *   *Cloak of charisma +2* (4,000 gp)
    *   Scroll of *divine power* (700 gp)
*   **Other Value:** 5,000 gp in scattered drow coins, corrupted religious artifacts, and perhaps a few dark gems.

**Total Calculated Value (including powerful items): ~265,000 gp.**

This is a very generous amount of treasure for an EL 16 encounter, primarily driven by Belkram's highly enchanted maul and the plot-significant crown. Be prepared for your players to be significantly more powerful if they fully utilize these items. You might consider adjusting the maul's properties or having it destroyed with Belkram to keep the treasure within a more typical range for the party's level if you feel it's too much.
