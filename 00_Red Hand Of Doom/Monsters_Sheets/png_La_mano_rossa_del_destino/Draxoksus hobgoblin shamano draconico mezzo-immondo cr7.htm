<hr />
<p><b>Blue Draconic Adapatation
 (Sp)
</b> Ventriloquism as the spell.</p>
<p><b>Blue Dragon Totem
</b> Gain a line of electricity breath weapon and bluff, hide, and spellcraft as class skills.</p>
<p><b>Breath Weapon
 (Su)
</b> At 4th level, you gain a breath weapon according to you dragon totem type. It will do 2d6 damage of the appropriate type in the specified area of effect. A successful Reflex save DC (10+CL/2+CON) halves the damage. Just like a real dragon, you must wait 1d4 rounds before using it again. Cone-shaped breath weapons extend out to 15 feet. Line-shaped breath weapons are 30 feet long.</p>
<p><b>Darkvision
 (Ex)
</b> Range 60 ft.; Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.</p>
<p><b>Draconic Adaptation1
</b> At 3rd level, you take on an aspect of your totem dragon. Some adaptations are extraordinary abilities that are always active and others are spell-like that can be activated at will.</p>
<p><b>Draconic Aura
 (Su)
</b> You can channel the mighty powers of dragon kind to project an aura that grants you and nearby allies a special benefit. Projecting an aura is a swift action and you can only have 1 active at a time. The bonus granted by your aura is 2. Unless otherwise noted, auras are 30-ft. radius centered on you.</p>
<p><b>Draconic Resolve
 (Ex)
</b> At 4th level, you gain immunity to paralysis and sleep effects. You also become immune to the frightful presence of dragons.</p>
<p><b>Dragon Totem
</b> You must choose a totem dragon from among the true dragon types (black, blue, brass, bronze, copper, gold, green, red, silver, or white). You must choose a dragon whose alignment is within one step of your own. You gain class skills and breath weapon based on your choice.</p>
<p><b>DS Skill Focus (Spellcraft)
</b> </p>
<p><b>Energy Shield (Draconic Aura)
 (Su)
</b> Any creature striking you or an ally with a natural attack or a nonreach melee weapon is dealt (2*2) damage. The energy type matches your dragon totems breath weapon.</p>
<p><b>Immunity To Dragon Fear
 (Ex)
</b> You are never subject to fear effects</p>
<p><b>Immunity to Paralysis
 (Ex)
</b> You can never be paralysed</p>
<p><b>Immunity to Poison
 (Ex)
</b> You never take poison damage</p>
<p><b>Immunity to Sleep
 (Ex)
</b> You are never subject to sleep effects</p>
<p><b>Outsider Type
</b> </p>
<p><b>Outsider Type
</b> Outsiders breathe but do not sleep/eat (though they can if they wish). Outsiders&#39; souls and bodies are one unit so cannot be restored to life by spells that restore souls to a body (requires a different effect such as a Wish or True Resurrection).</p>
<p><b>Power (Draconic Aura)
 (Su)
</b> Bonus on melee damage rolls equal to +2.</p>
<p><b>Presence (Draconic Aura)
 (Su)
</b> Bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks equal to +2.</p>
<p><b>Resistance to Acid
 (Ex)
</b> You may ignore 10 points of Acid damage each time you take Acid damage</p>
<p><b>Resistance to Cold
 (Ex)
</b> You may ignore 10 points of Cold damage each time you take Cold damage</p>
<p><b>Resistance to Electricity
 (Ex)
</b> You may ignore 10 points of Electricity damage each time you take Electricity damage</p>
<p><b>Resistance to Fire
 (Ex)
</b> You may ignore 10 points of Fire damage each time you take Fire damage</p>
<p><b>Senses (Draconic Aura)
 (Su)
</b> Bonus on Listen and Spot checks as well as on initiative checks equal to +2.</p>
<p><b>Skill Focus
</b> At 2nd level, you gain Skill Focus as a bonus feat. You must apply the feat to one of the three class skills granted by your chosen totem dragon. You gain additional picks at 8th and 16th level.</p>
<p><b>Smite Good
 (Su)
</b> Once per day the creature can make a normal melee attack to deal extra damage equal to its HD (maximum of +20) against a good foe.</p>
<p><b>Special Qualities
</b> <p>A half-fiend has all the special qualities of the base creature, plus the following special qualities. </p>
<p>Darkvision out to 60 feet. </p>
<p>Immunity to poison. </p>
<p>Resistance to acid 10, cold 10, electricity 10, and fire 10. </p>
<p>Damage reduction: 5/magic (if HD 11 or less) or 10/magic (if HD 12 or more). </p>
<p>A half-fiend&#39;s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. </p>
<p>Spell resistance equal to creature&#39;s HD + 10 (maximum 35).</p></p>
<p><b>Speed
</b> A half-fiend has bat wings. Unless the base creature has a better fly speed, the creature can fly at the base creature&#39;s base land speed (average maneuverability).</p>
<p><b>Vigor (Draconic Aura)
 (Su)
</b> Fast Healing 2, but only affects characters at or below one-half their full normal hit points.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> A dragon shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor types, and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
