<p><b>Associates
</b> While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.</p>
<p><b>Aura of Evil
 (Ex)
</b> The power of a blackguard&#39;s aura of evil (see the detect evil spell) is equal to his class level plus his cleric level, if any.</p>
<p><b>Code of Conduct
</b> A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin&#39;s code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.</p>
<p><b>Dark Blessing
 (Su)
</b> A blackguard applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws.</p>
<p><b>Darkvision
 (Ex)
</b> Range 60 ft.; Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.</p>
<p><b>Detect Good
 (Sp)
</b> At will, a blackguard can use detect good as a spell-like ability, duplicating the effect of the detect good spell.</p>
<p><b>Dwarf Racial Traits
 (Ex)
</b> <p>Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet with Darkvision. </p>
<p>Dwarves treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons. </p>
<p>Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn&#39;t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. </p>
<p>Stability: +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing firmly on the ground. </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects </p>
<p>+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids </p>
<p>+4 Dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items. </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.</p></p>
<p><b>Humanoid Type
</b> </p>
<p><b>Lay on Hands
</b> </p>
<p><b>Poison Use
</b> Blackguards are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.</p>
<p><b>Smite Good
 (Su)
</b> Once a day, a blackguard of 2nd level or higher may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per class level. For example, a 9th-level blackguard armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+9 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses from high Strength or magical effects that normally apply. If a blackguard accidentally smites a creature that is not good, the smite has no effect but it is still used up for that day. At 5th level, and again at 10th level, a blackguard may smite good one additional time per day.</p>
<p><b>Sneak Attack
</b> You can do an additional 1d6 damage if your opponent is unable to defend against you - whenever your opponent would be denied any dex bonus to AC, or you are flanking. Even at range (up to 30&#39;). Creatures immune to critical hits are also immune to this sneak bonus. This damage can be non-lethal only if you use a sap (blackjack) or unarmed attack</p>
<p><b>Sneak Attack
</b> +1d6</p>
<p><b>Spells
</b> A blackguard has the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. to cast a blackguard spell, a blackguard must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell&#39;s level, so a blackguard with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Blackguard bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the blackguard&#39;s Wisdom modifier. When the blackguard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level blackguard), he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The blackguard&#39;s spell list appears below. A blackguard has access to any spell on the list and can freely choose which to prepare, just as a cleric. A blackguard prepares and casts spells just as a cleric does (though a blackguard cannot spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells).</p>
<p><b>Trapfinding
</b> Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. A rogue who beats a trap&#39;s DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Blackguards are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
