Excellent points! The portal should definitely be visually obscured by the throne for its delayed reveal, and refining Urialle's and her yochlol minions' tactics, especially concerning the portal, is crucial. The permanent *desecrate* effect will also be integrated into the ambient description and all relevant stat blocks.

Let's build this definitive encounter!

### Encounter Setup and Player Description (Finalized)

As the players enter the desecrated shrine, read or paraphrase the following:

> The air in this vast, rectangular hall is not merely cold, but *malevolent*, heavy with a palpable sense of dread and decay that chills you to the bone. The ground itself feels unholy, radiating a pervasive aura of evil and necromancy. The space opens into a wider nave before you, where a series of thick, parallel columns stretches towards the far end, disappearing into the oppressive gloom. The entire area is lit by the sickly, flickering purple-green light of several strange drow torches mounted on the walls. This light clings to the shadows rather than dispelling them, making distances hard to judge and creating deceptive depths among the columns. Great, multi-limbed statues of what must have once been a dwarven deity—perhaps Moradin himself—stand in alcoves along the walls, but they have been brutally defaced. Hammers are shattered, faces are melted by acid, and Lolth's profane spider-web iconography is painted over the ancient runes. Piles of rubble from the destruction create difficult patches of terrain across the stone floor.
>
> At the far end of the wide nave, upon a grand throne of carved stone now draped in black silks, sits a horrifying figure. The dwarf Belkram, his skin pale and stretched tight over his bones, stares vacantly into the distance. His right hand rests on the pommel of a massive, fiery maul, while his left idly caresses the neck of a monstrous worg lying at his feet. The beast's fur is patchy, its flesh visibly pulsating, and a low, wet growl rumbles in its chest. On Belkram's head is a simple, elegant circlet of pure adamantine—the crown you seek.
>
> **Behind the throne, a high wall of dark, unadorned stone rises, completely obscuring anything beyond it.** A faint, rhythmic hum, barely perceptible beneath the oppressive silence, seems to emanate from the hidden space.

```
*   **Portal (P):** Hidden behind the throne and the wall (W). Urialle would be on the portal side of the wall. Players cannot see her or the portal until the wall is breached or Urialle phases through.
*   **Wall (W):** Provides total cover to Urialle and the portal from the main chamber. It could be breached with sufficient damage (e.g., stone wall, hardness 8, 360 hp per 10 ft. section, break DC 35). More likely, Urialle will use *greater teleport* or similar abilities to enter combat.
*   **Lighting:** Dim illumination throughout, creating a 20% miss chance for those without low-light vision.

*   **Rubble (R):** Difficult terrain, costing double movement.

*   **Statues (S):** Provide cover (+4 to AC).

*   **Columns (C):** Provide cover (+4 to AC). Creatures can use them to break line of sight.

*   **Hidden Yochlols (Y1, Y2):** The two lesser yochlols are hidden behind the columns, using the deep shadows and architectural features. A successful DC 28 Spot check is required to notice them before they act. They have ample cover to move and hide behind.

*   **Urialle (U) and Portal (P):** Urialle remains focused on the portal behind the throne, providing dim light in a 10-foot radius.

### Complete Tactics: The Lolth's Will Unleashed

This encounter is a carefully escalating gauntlet designed to tax the party's resources and decision-making.

#### **Phase 1: The Mad Dwarf and his Beast (EL 14 - Modified to reflect Desecrate)**

**Goal:** Overwhelm the front line, inflict significant damage, and burn player resources.
**Conditions:** Belkram and his Worg are active. Urialle and the other yochlols are inactive/hidden. The *desecrate* effect is active throughout.

*   **Belkram (CR 13):**
    *   **Pre-Combat:** Catatonic, clutching the maul and worg.
    *   **Initiation:** Upon player aggression/proximity (approx. 30 ft.), Belkram unleashes his guttural, blasphemous roar. He immediately enters **Corrupted Frenzy** (free action).
    *   **Round 1:** Charges the most heavily armored, direct threat (e.g., fighter, paladin) using **Power Attack (-2)** for maximum damage. His +2 profane bonus from *desecrate* means his attack rolls are now +23/+23/+18 and damage is 1d10+17 plus 2d6 vicious plus 2d6 unholy (vs good). He will not use spells.
    *   **Subsequent Frenzy Rounds (2-3):** Relentlessly attacks the nearest creature, prioritizing continued full attacks on the biggest melee threat. He is a pure damage-dealing engine.
    *   **Post-Frenzy (Rounds 4+):** If he survives and is out of frenzy, he becomes slightly more aware.
        *   If the party is hurt but still intact, he might use his *scroll of divine power* (standard action, provokes AoO) to rebuff himself, then continue melee.
        *   If severely injured, he might cast *inflict serious wounds* on himself to heal (standard action, provokes AoO). He will not use offensive spells unless melee is impossible. His fight is a desperate, cursed struggle.
*   **Corrupted Fiendish Dire Worg (CR 10):**
    *   **Initiation:** Responds instantly to Belkram's roar and frenzy.
    *   **Round 1:** Charges a *different* target than Belkram, preferably a lightly armored spellcaster or ranged attacker. It will use **Smite Good** against any visibly good-aligned foe, then attempt to **Trip** them to knock them prone, provoking AoOs from Belkram if in range.
    *   **Subsequent Rounds:** Focuses on targets Belkram isn't directly engaging, or attempts to flank Belkram's target to provide a bonus. Prioritizes tripping spellcasters to disrupt their actions. If forced to choose, it protects Belkram.

#### **Phase 2: The Horrors Emerge (Reinforcements - EL 11 x 2)**

**Goal:** Provide battlefield control, apply mental pressure, and begin isolating party members.
**Conditions:** Triggered when Belkram or his Worg is defeated. The *desecrate* effect is active.

> As [Belkram/the Worg] falls, a shriek of anger echoes, reverberating psychically through your minds. From behind two of the thick columns [indicate specific columns on map, e.g., Y1, Y2], two drow-like figures, each with the horrifying addition of four facial tentacles, slither into the dim light. Their multiple eyes glow with malevolent intelligence. "Fools! You impede the mistress's will!" one hisses telepathically.

*   **Half-Illithid Yochlols (2, CR 11 each):**
    *   **Initiation:** Emerge from behind their hiding columns. They prioritize targets *not* currently engaged in melee with the remaining Phase 1 villain.
    *   **Round 1 (Reinforcement):**
        *   **Tactics:** Move to gain line of sight to multiple party members (especially casters/archers) while using the columns for cover if possible. Each yochlol unleashes its **Mind Blast** in a cone, aiming to stun as many high-threat targets as possible.
    *   **Subsequent Rounds:**
        *   **Exploitation:** Focus on stunned or helpless targets, moving in to use their four tentacle attacks to establish a grapple. Their priority is to **Extract** brains for instant kills.
        *   **Battlefield Control:** Use *web* spell-like ability to entangle melee threats or block choke points. Use *darkness* to further obscure areas.
        *   **Mobility:** Utilize *spider climb* to scale columns or walls, gaining advantageous positions for ranged attacks (if they had any, but their focus is melee/psionics) or to drop down on isolated targets. *Gaseous Form* could be used to bypass front-liners to reach vulnerable backline members, though it leaves them vulnerable to some attacks. They are cunning and will try to separate the party.
        *   **Targeting:** They focus on physically weak targets first (wizards, sorcerers, rogues) that are vulnerable to grapple and extraction.

#### **Phase 3: The Architect's Wrath (Boss Fight - EL 14)**

**Goal:** Annihilate the party, protect the hidden portal, and fulfill Lolth's ritual.
**Conditions:** Triggered when one of the two lesser yochlols is defeated. The *desecrate* effect is active. Urialle becomes active.

> A psychic scream of pure, incandescent rage assaults your minds, raw and agonizing. The rhythmic hum from behind the throne surges into a thunderous, chaotic roar, and the stone wall behind it shimmers, then fades like a bad dream. Beyond, you see a vortex of swirling purple and green energy – a nascent portal – and standing before it, a drow-like figure of immense power, her four tentacles writhing with fury. "You have doomed yourselves!" Urialle's voice shrieks directly into your thoughts, burning with psychic force. "My sister's pain will be repaid a thousandfold! You will be the first sacrifices to the Web!"

*   **Half-Illithid Urialle (CR 14):**
    *   **Initiation:** Revealed by the fading wall, standing before the portal.
    *   **Round 1 (Urialle):**
        *   **Opening Move:** Unleashes her **Mind Blast** (DC 22 Will save) from her vantage point, targeting any part of the party not already stunned, focusing on casters or healers.
        *   **Primary Buff:** Casts *divine power* on herself (assuming she still has favored soul levels or a similar spell-like ability for it, if not, she'd use *bull's strength* from her list) to boost her own melee capabilities if she intends to engage directly. *(Self-correction: Urialle is Half-Illithid Sorcerer 6/Eldritch Knight 1, not Favored Soul, so she doesn't have *divine power*. However, her base stats are already strong. She would use *shield* if she needs more defense or *shocking grasp* if a target is close)*.
    *   **Subsequent Rounds:**
        *   **Control and Domination:** Her priority is battlefield control. She will attempt to cast *dominate person* (DC 18) on the party's primary melee damage dealer, turning them against their allies. If *dominate person* fails or is not appropriate, she will use *suggestion* (via psionics, DC 19) to sow confusion or isolate targets.
        *   **Spell Offense:** Uses *web* to entangle, *darkness* to obscure, or *touch of idiocy* to debilitate casters.
        *   **Lethal Melee:** If a party member gets close, she will engage with her 4 tentacles and *+2 anarchic two-bladed sword*. Her high Dexterity and Weapon Finesse make her dangerous. She will focus on squishy targets or those she can quickly bring to "Extract" status.
        *   **Portal Defense:** If players attempt to directly attack the portal, Urialle becomes singularly focused on preventing this, using her full arsenal to eliminate the threat. She will verbally (telepathically) taunt and gloat.
        *   **Mobility:** Uses *greater teleport* (self only, at will) to reposition if flanked, isolated, or to gain a tactical advantage. She will use *spider climb* to scale walls or columns for a better vantage or escape if needed.
        *   **Mind Blank:** Remember her constant *mind blank* protects her from many psychic assaults.
