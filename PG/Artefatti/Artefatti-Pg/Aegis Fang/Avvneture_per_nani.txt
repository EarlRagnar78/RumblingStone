Avventure per Nani

And I forgot Dungeon Crawl Classics 44: Dreaming Caves of the Duergar. So, by level

(1) Hollow's Last Hope
(2) Crown of the Kobold King (possibly just forge level)
(3-5) Forge of Fury
(5) Revenge of the Kobold King (with strong ties to dwarf party)
(6)Hungry are the Dead (BBEG is an Orc undead or lich who wants to establish an orc kingdom in the Five Kings Mountains)
(6/7) The Beggar's Pearl (maybe push that up to level 8)
(10) Clash of the Kingslayers
Could tie Axe of the Dwarvish Lords into Kingslayers for a big finale.

Probably not used:
(1-3) Dreaming Caves of the Duergar
(10) Glory Hole Dwarven Mine (too much updating)

Possible dwarf pieces from Tomb of Abysthor and Slumbering Tsar as encounters.

Shaping up, though not as solid as I'd like.



@Azaelas - I was using Revenge of Kobold King and Hungry are the Dead as my defaults (I'm a big fan of the Darkmoon Vale stuff). But I wanted to find more inherently 'dwarfy' stuff after Droskar's crucible.

I haven't read Godsmouth Heresy.

Warlords of the Accordlands is a FANTASTIC third edition campaign setting: just about my favorite. Turned out pretty dwarf-useful. I liked what I found more than On Corrupted Ground (which is still interesting).

Starting out in Darkmoon Vale, I think I can put together a thematic 1-10 (or 15) campaign that results in reclaiming the Kravenkus sky citadel in the World Spin Mountains. Or at least, claim a couple key parts that lead into offscreen re-establishing of the fortress for the Ninth Batallion (Faction Guide book).
