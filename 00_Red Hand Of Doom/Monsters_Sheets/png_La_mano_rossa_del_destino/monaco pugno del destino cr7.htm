<p><b>AC Bonus
 (Ex)
</b> A monk is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks. When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level). These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.</p>
<p><b>Bonus Feat
</b> A Monk can choose certain bonus combat feats at certain levels, without meeting their pre-requisites</p>
<p><b>Evasion
 (Ex)
</b> A monk of 2nd level or higher can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon&#39;s fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk (such as one who is unconscious or paralysed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><b>Fast Movement
 (Ex)
</b> At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed, as shown on Table 3-10. A monk in armor (even light armor) or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>
<p><b>Flurry of Blows
 (Ex)
</b> When unarmored, as a full attack action using unarmed or special monk weapons, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. Making one extra attack at your highest attack bonus, but with a -1 penalty to all attacks (including attacks of opportunity) that round.  When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.</p>
<p><b>Ki Strike
 (Su)
</b> At 4th level, a monk&#39;s unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction (see Damage Reduction, page 291 of the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide). Ki strike improves with the character&#39;s monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness (see Smashing an Object, page 165). Magic</p>
<p><b>Purity of Body
 (Ex)
</b> At 5th level, a monk gains control over her body&#39;s immune system. She gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases (such as mummy rot and lycanthropy).</p>
<p><b>Slow Fall
 (Ex)
</b> a monk within arm&#39;s reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 40 feet shorter than it actually is.</p>
<p><b>Still Mind
 (Ex)
</b> A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment, since her meditation and training improve her resistance to mind-affecting attacks.</p>
<p><b>Unarmed Strike
</b> Monks are highly trained in fighting unarmed, giving them considerable advantages when doing so. At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk&#39;s attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes. Usually a monk&#39;s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling. A monk&#39;s unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons (such as the magic fang and magic weapon spells). A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table 3-10: The Monk. The unarmed damage on Table 3-10 is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Monks are proficient with certain basic peasant weapons and some special weapons that are part of monk training. Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields-in fact, many of the monk&#39;s special powers require unfettered movement. When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.</p>
<p><b>Wholeness of Body
 (Su)
</b> At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.</p>
