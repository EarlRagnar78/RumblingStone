<p><b>Aura
</b> A cleric has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity&#39;s alignment</p>
<p><b>Aura of Good
 (Ex)
</b> </p>
<p><b>Aura of Law
 (Ex)
</b> Overwhelming</p>
<p><b>Craft Domain Skill Focus Choice (Craft (Blacksmithing))
</b> </p>
<p><b>Hammer Specialist
 (Ex)
</b> A dwarf cleric&#39;s dedication to the forge-god results in exceptional skill with the warhammer. A dwarf cleric who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level gains the Martial Weapon Proficiency (warhammer) feat (if she doesn&#39;t already have it). She also gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when wielding a warhammer in melee. This racial substitution level is only available to dwarf clerics who follow Moradin (or any other deity whose favored weapon is a warhammer). This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 4th level. From now on, the cleric can prepare one fewer 2nd-level cleric spell than indicated on Table 3-6, page 31 of the Player&#39;s Handbook.</p>
<p><b>Humanoid Type
</b> </p>
<p><b>Smite Giants
 (Su)
</b> A dwarf cleric who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level can attempt to smite a giant with a melee attack, similar to the way a paladin smites an evil creature. She adds her Constitution bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per cleric level. The cleric can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Con modifier (minimum once per day). If the cleric accidentally smites a creature that is not a giant, the smite has no effect but still counts as one of the cleric&#39;s daily smite attempts. This substitution benefit replaces the standard cleric&#39;s ability to turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Spells
</b> A cleric casts divine spells. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains. Clerics do not acquire their spells from books or scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study. Instead, they meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them through their own strength of faith or as divine inspiration. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells, and decide which ones to choose for that day. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells.</p>
<p><b>Spontaneous Casting
</b> </p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> The expert is proficient in the use of all simple weapons and with light armor but not shields.</p>
