Enhanced Spell Turrets Trap (For a CR 10 Encounter)
General Characteristics

    Number: 2 Spell Turrets

    Nature: Diminutive magical constructs that masquerade as innocuous decorative elements until activated.

    Trigger: A visual trigger (e.g., when a creature with true seeing or magical detection comes within 30 feet) sets them off.

    Reset: They automatically reset (every 24 hours) after an encounter.

    Self-Repair: Every fifth round, instead of casting a spell, each turret repairs itself by regaining 4d8 + 20 HP.

Updated Stats

    Effective CR: Each turret is now roughly CR 6, so as a pair they represent a well-rounded threat for a level‑10 party.

    AC: 18 (up from 7)

    Hardness: 8 (unchanged)

    HP: 350 (up from 200)

    Search DC: 31 (up from 27)

    Disable Device DC: 31 (up from 27)

Spell Sequences

Each turret maintains two distinct spell sequences—one representing a set of cleric-based spells (T7 spells) and the other wizard-based spells (T11 spells). In a fixed cycle, a turret casts one spell per round in the order given; no spell is cast on the fifth round, as that round is devoted to self-repair. The cycle then repeats.
Enhanced T7 Spells (Cleric-Based)

    Enhanced Sound Burst:

        Effect: A booming sonic explosion fills a 20‑foot radius.

        Save: Reflex DC 17 for half damage.

        Damage: Deals 6d6 thunder damage.

    Enhanced Summon Monster II:

        Effect: Conjures a Medium fiendish monstrous spider with venomous capabilities.

        Additional Abilities: Its bite deals 2d8 poison damage on a failed Fortitude save (DC 17).

    Enhanced Hold Person:

        Effect: Paralyzes a humanoid target temporarily.

        Save: Will DC 17 negates the effect.

    Second Summon Monster II:

        Effect: Summons another Medium fiendish monstrous spider, similar in ability to the first.

Enhanced T11 Spells (Wizard-Based)

    Enhanced Web:

        Effect: Conjures a sticky web in a 20‑foot square area.

        Save: Reflex DC 17 to avoid being entangled.

    Enhanced Summon Swarm:

        Effect: Summons a swarm of spiders that lasts for 4 rounds.

        Save/Effect: Affected targets must make a Reflex save (DC 17) to reduce the swarm’s damage, which averages 2d6.

    Enhanced Darkness:

        Effect: Creates a magical darkness (30‑foot radius) that even darkvision cannot penetrate, lasting for 1 minute.

    Third Summon Monster II:

        Effect: Summons yet another Medium fiendish monstrous spider with enhanced abilities (as detailed above).
        
  //////////////////////////
  
  Elite Fiendish Monstrous Spider (CR 9 Version)

Type: Medium Magical Beast (Extraplanar, Fiendish)
Size: Medium (space 5 ft./5 ft.)

Hit Dice: 10d8+28 (average ≈79 HP)
(Increased HD represents advanced creature power rather than a change in physical size.)

Initiative: +3
(A slightly sharper Dexterity bonus for quicker reactions.)

Speed: 30 ft. (6 squares); Climb 20 ft.

Armor Class: 18

    Touch: 14

    Flat-footed: 15
    (Improved natural armor and Dexterity help it avoid hits.)

Base Attack/Grapple: +8 / +12
Attacks

    Bite:

        Attack Bonus: +7 melee

        Damage: 2d6+4 piercing

        Special: The bite delivers a potent poison

Poison (Ex)

    Save: Fortitude DC 16

    Effect:

        On a failed save, the target takes 2d6 points of Strength damage immediately and suffers an additional 2d6 Strength damage as secondary damage after 1 round.

        In addition, the victim becomes staggered for 1 round as the venom disrupts muscle control.

        A successful save halves both damage components and prevents the stagger.

(The enhanced poison (higher DC and damage) makes a failed save far more debilitating.)
Special Qualities

    Tremorsense: 60 ft.

    Darkvision: 60 ft.

    Web (Ex) [Optional]:

        Can use a web attack to entangle foes (similar to a net attack).

        Targets caught in the web must succeed on an Escape Artist check (DC 16) or a Strength check (DC 20) to break free.

(You can incorporate the web ability to add area control without altering the creature’s size.)
Saves

    Fortitude: +7

    Reflex: +8

    Will: +4

(Reflecting its improved Constitution and overall combat durability.)
Ability Scores

    Strength: 15

    Dexterity: 18

    Constitution: 14

    Intelligence: 3

    Wisdom: 10

    Charisma: 2

(Upgraded physical scores increase its melee damage, AC, and hit points.)
Skills & Feats

    Skills: Climb +14, Hide +7, Spot +4

    Feats: Weapon Finesse (applied to its bite), Improved Initiative, and any other feats that emphasize survivability or combat prowess.

Tactical Considerations

    Damage Threat: A bite that not only deals higher base damage (2d6+4) but also a crippling poison effect forces PCs to manage their resources (such as spells or healing) to overcome the Strength loss and stagger condition.

    Durability: With roughly 104 HP and improved saves, the spider can endure multiple rounds of combat, pressuring the party with persistent threat.

    Area Control: The optional web attack can hinder PC movement, setting up further strikes or isolating vulnerable party members.

This enhanced stat block preserves the creature’s Medium size and basic theme while scaling its threat level to be a formidable opponent for a CR 10 party.
