<p><b>Darkvision
 (Ex)
</b> Range 120 ft.; Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.</p>
<p><b>Dwarf Racial Traits
 (Ex)
</b> <p>Dwarves can see in the dark up to 120 feet with Darkvision. </p>
<p>Dwarves treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons. </p>
<p>Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn&#39;t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. </p>
<p>Stability: +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing firmly on the ground. </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects </p>
<p>+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids </p>
<p>+4 Dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items. </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.</p></p>
<p><b>Evasion
</b> </p>
<p><b>Evasion
 (Ex)
</b> At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon&#39;s fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue (such as one who is unconscious or paralysed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><b>Familiar
</b> </p>
<p><b>Familiar
</b> A wizard can obtain a familiar. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.</p>
<p><b>Humanoid Type
</b> </p>
<p><b>Immunity to Paralysis
 (Ex)
</b> You can never be paralysed</p>
<p><b>Immunity to Phantasms
 (Ex)
</b> You are never fooled by phantasms</p>
<p><b>Immunity to Poison
 (Ex)
</b> You never take poison damage</p>
<p><b>Light Sensitivity
</b> Duergar are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.</p>
<p><b>Scribe Scroll
</b> At 1st level, a wizard gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. This feats enables her to create magic schools (see Scribe Scroll, page 99, and Creating Magic Items, page 282 of the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide).</p>
<p><b>Sneak Attack
</b> You can do an additional 2d6 damage if your opponent is unable to defend against you - whenever your opponent would be denied any dex bonus to AC, or you are flanking. Even at range (up to 30&#39;). Creatures immune to critical hits are also immune to this sneak bonus. This damage can be non-lethal only if you use a sap (blackjack) or unarmed attack</p>
<p><b>Sneak Attack
</b> +2d6</p>
<p><b>Spell-Like Abilities
</b> 1/day-enlarge person and invisibility as a wizard of twice the duergar&#39;s class level (minimum caster level 3rd); these abilities affect only the duergar and whatever it carries.</p>
<p><b>Trapfinding
</b> Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. A rogue who beats a trap&#39;s DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.</p>
<p><b>Trap Sense
</b> Character has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard&#39;s movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.</p>
