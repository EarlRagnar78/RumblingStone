        "In the breaking dawn, I cast both light and shadow. My path walks between Lathander's radiance and Mask's mysteries, for in duality lies true power."
    </div>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="two-column">
        <p>The Lord of Sun and Shadow represents a rare spiritual awakening among those who channel eldritch power. These warlocks have discovered that true power comes not from darkness alone, but from embracing both the brilliant dawn of Lathander and the mysterious shadows of Mask. Their magic blends divine radiance with stealthy shadow, creating a unique fusion that allows them to walk between worlds.</p>
        
        <p>Most warlocks are drawn to darker powers, making the Lord of Sun and Shadow an anomaly. Their journey begins when they experience a transformative vision—often during dawn or dusk—where both Lathander and Mask reveal complementary truths about the universe. They learn that light defines shadow, and shadow accentuates light; one cannot exist without the other.</p>
        
        <p>These enlightened warlocks channel their eldritch power through this philosophical duality. Their invocations take on aspects of both divine radiance and shadowy stealth. Their presence can be as blinding as the morning sun or as subtle as a thief in the night, depending on the need of the moment.</p>

    <h2>Class Features</h2>
    
    <h3>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3>
    <p>Lords of Sun and Shadow gain no additional weapon proficiencies, but they do gain proficiency with light armor if they don't already have it.</p>
    
    <h3><span class="ability-name">Light Armor Mastery</span> <span class="ability-type">(Ex)</span></h3>
    <p>At 1st level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow can cast spells and use invocations while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance.</p>
    
    <h3><span class="ability-name">Twilight Blast</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 1st level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow's eldritch blast undergoes a fundamental transformation. The blast becomes a swirling fusion of divine radiance and shadow essence. Half of the damage dealt by the eldritch blast becomes divine damage, while the other half becomes fire damage. This damage is not subject to resistance or immunity to fire damage, though creatures with specific divine damage resistances may apply them.</p>
    
    <h3><span class="ability-name">Shadow Step</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 2nd level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow can travel between shadows as a standard action. You can teleport from one shadow or area of darkness to another as if using <em>dimension door</em>, with a range of 20 feet per class level. The starting and ending points must both be in areas of shadow or darkness. After using this ability, you cannot use it again for 1d4 rounds.</p>
    
    <h3><span class="ability-name">Blessing of the Morning Lord</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 3rd level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow gains resistance to negative energy equal to their class level + their Charisma modifier. Additionally, they gain a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy drain, and necromancy spells or effects.</p>
    
    <h3><span class="ability-name">Mask's Guile</span> <span class="ability-type">(Ex)</span></h3>
    <p>At 4th level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow becomes more adept at stealth and deception. They gain a +4 competence bonus to Hide and Move Silently checks. Additionally, they gain a +2 bonus to Bluff and Disguise checks. These bonuses increase by +1 for every two additional Lord of Sun and Shadow levels beyond 4th.</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h3><span class="ability-name">Enhanced Twilight Blast</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 5th level, your Twilight Blast becomes even more potent. In addition to the half divine/half fire damage type, your eldritch blast gains one of the following additional effects (chosen when you attain 5th level):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Solar Ray:</strong> Your eldritch blast now dazzles targets for 1d4 rounds on a failed Fortitude save (DC 10 + half your class level + your Charisma modifier). Against undead, this effect blinds for 1 round instead of dazzling.</li>
        <li><strong>Shadow Veil:</strong> Your eldritch blast creates wisps of shadow around the target. On a failed Will save (DC 10 + half your class level + your Charisma modifier), the target suffers a -2 penalty to AC for 1d4 rounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Twilight Bond:</strong> Your eldritch blast marks the target with twilight energy. For 1d4 rounds after being struck, the target takes 1 extra point of damage per die from any subsequent eldritch blasts or spells you cast that deal fire or divine damage.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><span class="ability-name">Dawn's Revelation</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 5th level, once per day, a Lord of Sun and Shadow can invoke the revealing light of dawn as a standard action. This creates an effect similar to <em>faerie fire</em> in a 60-foot radius centered on you, but it also reveals invisible creatures and objects as if by <em>see invisibility</em>. This effect lasts for 1 round per class level.</p>
    
    <h3><span class="ability-name">Twilight Invocation</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 6th level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow can blend the power of sun and shadow into their <strong>warlock invocations</strong>. Once per day, when using any warlock invocation that deals damage (such as <em>eldritch spear</em>, <em>hideous blow</em>, or <em>vitriolic blast</em>), you can declare it a Twilight Invocation. The damage from the invocation becomes half divine and half fire damage (like your Twilight Blast), and the saving throw DC increases by 2. At 9th level, this ability can be used twice per day.</p>
    
    <p><em>Note: This is different from Twilight Blast, which permanently changes your eldritch blast. Twilight Invocation is a temporary enhancement you can apply to other warlock invocations that deal damage.</em></p>
    
    <h3><span class="ability-name">Shroud of Shadows</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 7th level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow can enshroud themselves in protective shadows as an immediate action. This grants concealment (20% miss chance) for 1 round per class level. While this ability is active, you gain a +4 bonus to Hide checks, even when being observed. This ability can be used once per encounter.</p>
    
    <h3><span class="ability-name">Solar Flare</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 8th level, once per day as a standard action, a Lord of Sun and Shadow can create a burst of brilliant sunlight from their hands. This acts as a 20-foot-radius <em>sunburst</em> centered on you. Creatures in the area take 6d6 points of divine damage and 6d6 points of fire damage (Reflex save for half damage, DC 10 + class level + Charisma modifier). Undead creatures take double damage.</p>
    
    <h3><span class="ability-name">Shadow's Embrace</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 9th level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow can become one with the shadows for a brief period. As a standard action, you can transform into shadow for up to 1 round per class level. While in this form, you gain incorporeality and can fly at a speed of 40 feet with perfect maneuverability. You can still cast spells and use invocations while in shadow form. This ability can be used once per day.</p>
    
    <h3><span class="ability-name">Avatar of Twilight</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 10th level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow reaches the pinnacle of their power. Once per day as a swift action, you can transform into an Avatar of Twilight for 1 round per class level. While in this form, you gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Twilight Blast damage increases by 2d6</li>
        <li>You can use Shadow Step as a move action with no cooldown</li>
        <li>You gain damage reduction 10/good or evil</li>
        <li>You gain immunity to blindness, dazzling effects, and gaze attacks</li>
        <li>Your movement speed increases by 30 feet</li>
        <li>You gain a +4 bonus to your Charisma score</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Invocations</h3>
    <p>At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow gains new invocations known as if he had also gained a level in the warlock class. The grade of invocations you can learn is determined by your effective warlock level (warlock level + half Lord of Sun and Shadow level, rounded down).</p>
    
    <h3>Spells</h3>
    <p>Beginning at 2nd level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast a spell, you must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level. Saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + your Charisma modifier. You cast spells as a sorcerer and follow the sorcerer spell progression for spells per day and spells known.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Spells Known:</strong> At 2nd level, you learn 2 first-level spells. When you gain access to a new spell level, you automatically learn 2 spells of that level. At each subsequent level after gaining a new spell level, you learn 1 additional spell of any level you can cast. At 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level (even levels where you don't gain a new spell level), you may replace one spell you know with a different spell of the same level or lower.</p>

    <h2>Playing a Lord of Sun and Shadow</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Combat:</strong> In battle, you are versatile and unpredictable. Strike from shadows with your enhanced eldritch blast, teleport around the battlefield using Shadow Step, or emerge in a blaze of divine light to devastate your enemies. Your tactics should involve alternating between stealth and direct confrontation, keeping opponents off-balance.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Advancement:</strong> Focus on enhancing your Charisma to improve your spellcasting and invocations. Prioritize skills like Hide, Move Silently, and Spellcraft. Feats that enhance your eldritch blast or provide additional magical versatility are excellent choices, such as Ability Focus (Eldritch Blast), Extra Invocation, Spell Penetration, or Quicken Spell-Like Ability.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Resources:</strong> Lords of Sun and Shadow are rare, making formal organizations or mentors scarce. Both temples of Lathander and secretive cults of Mask may provide assistance—though rarely simultaneously. You'll need to carefully navigate your dual allegiances, as the faithful of each deity may view your devotion to the other with suspicion.</p>
    
    <h2>Lore</h2>
    
    <div class="quote">
        "I watched him emerge from the shadows, hands glowing with divine fire. The undead horde shriveled before him like morning mist before the sun. In that moment, I understood that light and shadow are not opposed—they are complementary forces in the hands of those wise enough to see beyond dualism."<br>
        —Eldrin Mostana, High Priest of Lathander

    <p>Lords of Sun and Shadow often find themselves as natural mediators, bridging gaps between different factions or serving as diplomatic envoys. Some operate as specialized monster hunters, particularly effective against undead and fiends. Others become guardians of sacred sites where light and darkness meet—twilight groves, mountaintop temples that capture both dawn and dusk, or ancient ruins where shadow and light create patterns of mystical significance.</p>
    
    <p>Some believe that the first Lord of Sun and Shadow was originally a thief who attempted to steal a sacred sunburst symbol from a temple of Lathander at dawn, only to experience a divine vision that transformed their understanding of light and darkness. Both Lathander and Mask are said to view these unique warlocks with a mixture of amusement and interest, occasionally sending direct challenges or blessings to test their devotion.</p>
