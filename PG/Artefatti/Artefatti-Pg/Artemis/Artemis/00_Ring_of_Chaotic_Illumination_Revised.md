## Physical Description

The ring appears as a band of polished obsidian pulsating with an inner violet light. Following the bearer's interaction with the **Eternal Forge** and their rejection of the *Lord of Sun and Shadow* path to forge their own destiny, the ring has physically evolved to reflect this balance.
*   **Gold Veins:** Thin veins of Lathander's gold now run through the black stone, symbolizing the light of dawn.
*   **Silver Glyphs:** Mask's silver sigils shift and dance along the rim, representing the shadows.
*   **Violet Core:** The warlock's chaotic essence binds them together, visible as a deep violet glow.
*   **Inscription:** When touched by a chaotic warlock, infernal inscriptions manifest on its surface, reading *"True power comes from Chaos and Light"* in Infernal script. To all others, it appears as a simple cobalt blue aquamarine ring.

## History & Awakening

Originally forged during the **Era of Torments**, when the gods walked Toril, this ring was created during a crucial battle between divine forces. Centuries later, it was recovered by the powerful Netherese mage **Vess'ith Shadowweaver**, retaining fragments of its original divine power.

Recently, the ring was re-awakened in the **Hall of the Eternal Forge**. The bearer, **Artemis**, refused the path to become a blazing symbol of two gods, choosing instead to rely on his own chaotic nature. Recognizing this resolve, the ring absorbed the essence of the **Mithral Column of Unity** and the **Dual Flames** of the Forge, evolving into a true artifact of balance.
