<p><b>Air Traits
</b> </p>
<p><b>Air Traits
</b> Air creatures always have fly speeds and usually have perfect maneuverability</p>
<p><b>Blindsense
 (Ex)
</b> Range 60; The creature has blindsense, a lesser ability that lets the creature notice things it cannot see, but without the precision of blindsight. The creature with blindsense usually does not need to make Spot or Listen checks to notice and locate creatures within range of its blindsense ability, provided that it has line of effect to that creature. Any opponent the creature cannot see has total concealment (50% miss chance) against the creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see.</p>
<p><b>Breath Weapon
 (Su)
</b> 40&#39; Cone of Corrosive Gas 8d6 acid DC 21</p>
<p><b>Darkvision
 (Ex)
</b> Range 120; Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.</p>
<p><b>Dragon Traits
</b> </p>
<p><b>Dragon Traits
</b> Dragons eat/sleep/breathe. Dragons are Immune to magic sleep effects and paralysis effects.</p>
<p><b>Immunity To Acid
 (Ex)
</b> You never take Acid damage</p>
<p><b>Immunity To Paralysis
 (Ex)
</b> You can never be paralysed</p>
<p><b>Immunity To Sleep
 (Ex)
</b> You are never subject to sleep effects</p>
<p><b>Keen Senses
 (Ex)
</b> A dragon sees four times as well as a human in shadowy illumination and twice as well in normal light.</p>
<p><b>Low-Light Vision
 (Ex)
</b> You can see 4x as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.</p>
<p><b>Water Breathing
 (Ex)
</b> </p>
