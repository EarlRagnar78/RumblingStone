Well‑Camouflaged Pit and Pendulum Trap (Revised CR 10)

    Type: Mechanical trap with a location trigger and automatic reset (every 24 hours)

    Trigger: When a creature steps on a concealed pressure plate, the trap is activated.

Trap Components

    The Pit:

        Description: A seemingly solid floor gives way to reveal a deep, hidden pit.

        Depth: 30 feet deep

        Falling Damage: On a failed Reflex save, a creature falls 30 feet, taking 3d6 points of falling damage (averaging about 10.5 damage).

    The Pendulum:

        Description: Simultaneously with the pit opening, a massive pendulum—suspiciously camouflaged to blend with the environment—swings down from above along a 25‑foot arc.

        Attack: The pendulum makes a melee “attack” with an effective bonus of +25.

        Damage: On a hit, it deals 4d10+20 points of bludgeoning damage.

        Additional Effect: A critical hit (as determined by the trap’s design) might leave the target dazed for 1 round, representing the disorienting blow.

Saving Throws & Skill Checks

    Reflex Save (to avoid the pit): DC 27

        A successful save means the creature evades falling into the pit. (It might still be subjected to the pendulum if its area of effect overlaps the escape route.)

    Search Check (to notice the trap): DC 34

        Characters can use their Spot or Search skills to detect the well-camouflaged nature of the pit and any subtle signs of the pendulum mechanism.

    Disable Device Check (to disarm the trap): DC 27

        With careful work, a character can disable the pressure plate or interrupt the pendulum mechanism before it activates.
