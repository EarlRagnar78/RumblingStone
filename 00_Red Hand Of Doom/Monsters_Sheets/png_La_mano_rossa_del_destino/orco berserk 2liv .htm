<p><b>Darkvision
 (Ex)
</b> Range 60 ft.; Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.</p>
<p><b>Darkvision
</b> A mountain orc has Darkvision out to 60 feet.</p>
<p><b>Fast Movement
 (Ex)
</b> A barbarian&#39;s land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian&#39;s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. For example, a human barbarian has a speed of 40 feet, rather than 30 feet, when wearing light or no armor. When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 30 feet. A halfling barbarian has a speed of 30 feet, rather than 20 feet, in light or no armor. When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 20 feet.</p>
<p><b>Humanoid Type
</b> </p>
<p><b>Illiteracy
</b> Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak. A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.</p>
<p><b>Illiteracy
</b> All mountain orcs are illiterate unless they have a level in a class other than barbarian.</p>
<p><b>Light Sensitivity
 (Ex)
</b> Mountain orcs suffer a -1 penalty on attack rolls in bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.</p>
<p><b>Mountain Orc Traits
</b> </p>
<p><b>Orc Blood
</b> For all special abilities and effects, a mountain orc is considered an orc. Mountain orcs for example, can use or create orc weapons and magic items with racially specific orc powers as if they were orcs.</p>
<p><b>Rage
 (Ex)
</b> A barbarian can fly into a screaming blood frenzy a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian gains phenomenal strength and durability but becomes reckless and less able to defend himself. He temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian&#39;s hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are; see Temporary Hit Points, page 146.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character&#39;s (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can&#39;t charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see below). A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action (see Initiative, page 136), not in response to someone else&#39;s action. A barbarian can&#39;t, for example, fly into a rage when struck down by an arrow in order to get the extra hit points from the increased Constitution, although the extra hit points would be of benefit if he had gone into a rage earlier in the round, before the arrow struck</p>
<p><b>Rage
 (Ex)
</b> 1 times/day (7 rounds) Bonuses when enraged (STR +4, CON +4, Will +2, AC -2, HP 4)</p>
<p><b>Uncanny Dodge
 (Ex)
</b> At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class (a barbarian with at least four levels of rogue, for example), he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><b>Weapon Proficiency
</b> Mountain orcs are proficient with the greataxe and the javelin; they train with these weapons from childhood.</p>
