Constrict (Ex): On a successful grapple check, a grell patriarch
deals 1d8+4 points of damage.

Expert Grappler (Ex): A grell that chooses to grapple with
one tentacle and remain ungrappled itself takes a –10 penalty
on its grapple checks instead of the normal –20 penalty
(see Improved Grab, page 310 of the Monster Manual, for
details).
Grell patriarchs have a +10 racial bonus on grapple checks.
(Paralyzed foes automatically lose grapple checks.)

Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a grell must hit an
opponent of its size or smaller with a tentacle attack. It can
then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without pro-
voking attacks of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it
establishes a hold and can constrict.

Paralysis (Ex): Any creature hit by a grell patriarch’s tentacle
must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d4
rounds. Each additional tentacle that hits the same creature
that round increases the save DC by 1.

Sightless (Ex): A grell patriarch is immune to gaze attacks,
visual effects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on
sight.

Greater Lightning Lance
A larger and more powerful version of the lightning lance,
a greater lightning lance is found in the tentacles of the
philosophers and patriarchs. It resembles a slender silver tube 5
feet long. This weapon deals 5d6 points of electricity damage (no
save) to a single enemy with a successful ranged touch
attack (range 60 feet). If this touch attack hits, the electricity bolt then arcs to a second
target of the user’s choice within 30 feet of the primary target,
dealing 5d6 points of damage (no save) to the secondary target
with a second successful ranged touch attack.
A greater lightning lance usually functions only in the grasp
of a grell, although a DC 25 Use Magic Device check allows
a character of a different race to employ the weapon. A greater
lightning lance has 7 charges. Spent charges are renewed each day,
so a wielder can expend up to 7 charges in any 24-hour period.
Faint evocation; CL 5th; Grell Alchemy, shocking grasp; Price
18,000 gp.

The patriarch is inclined to stand its ground against all
but the most dangerous enemies. It uses greater invisibility
early in the fight and attacks brazenly, seeking to overcome
intruders with a sudden assault. If the heroes seem capable
of defeating its invisibility, the monster uses web or slow to
hinder the party while picking on lone characters who are
far from help.
The patriarch has naturally claimed the lion’s share of
the treasure discovered in and around the ruins of Sangkon
Bhet. Its loot consists of 3,700 sp, 2,900 gp, 55 pp, a fine
jade statuette worth 650 gp, two rubies worth 300 gp each,
and three small diamonds worth 230 gp each. The explor-
ers’ belongings include a suit of +2 studded leather armor,
a +1 flaming short sword, a cloak of elvenkind, and a scroll of
neutralize poison.
