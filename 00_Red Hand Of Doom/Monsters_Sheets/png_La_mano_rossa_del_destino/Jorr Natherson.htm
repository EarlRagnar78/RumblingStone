<p><b>Animal Companion
</b> </p>
<p><b>Animal Companion
 (Ex)
</b> At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the DM&#39;s campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the DM may add the following creatures to the ranger&#39;s list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. (For instance, an aquatic creature can&#39;t adventure with a ranger on land and shouldn&#39;t be selected by a nonaquatic character without extenuating circumstances). In most cases, the animal companion functions as a mount, sentry, scout, or hunting animal, rather than as a protector. This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name (see page 35), except that the ranger&#39;s effective druid level is one-half his ranger level. For example, the animal companion of a 4th-level ranger would be the equivalent of a 2nd-level druid&#39;s animal companion. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Thus, he must be at least an 8th-level ranger to select from the druid&#39;s list of 4th-level animal companions, and if he chooses one of those animals, his effective druid level would be reduced by 3, to 1st level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.</p>
<p><b>Archery Combat Style
</b> The Ranger has chosen to specialise in Archery</p>
<p><b>Combat Style
 (Ex)
</b> At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character&#39;s class features but does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any way. If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. The benefits of the ranger&#39;s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p>
<p><b>Endurance
</b> A ranger gains Endurance (see page 93) as a bonus feat at 3rd level.</p>
<p><b>Evasion
</b> </p>
<p><b>Evasion
 (Ex)
</b> At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon&#39;s fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue (such as one who is unconscious or paralysed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.</p>
<p><b>Favored Enemy
 (Ex)
</b> At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table 3-14: Ranger Favored Enemies. Due to his extensive study on his chosen type of foe and training in the proper techniques for combating such creatures, the ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. For example, a 5th-level ranger has two favored enemies; against one he gains a +4 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks and weapon damage rolls, and against the other he has a +2 bonus. At 10th level, he has three favored enemies, and he gains an additional +2 bonus, which he can allocate to the bonus against any one of his three favored enemies. Thus, his bonuses could be either +4, +4, +2 or +6, +2, +2. If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy (for instance, devils are both evil outsiders and lawful outsiders), the ranger&#39;s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher. See the Monster Manual for more information on types of creatures.</p>
<p><b>Feat Bonus
</b> 1 extra feat at 1st level.</p>
<p><b>Humanoid (Goblinoid)
 (Ex)
</b> Gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.</p>
<p><b>Humanoid Type
</b> </p>
<p><b>Human Racial Traits
 (Ex)
</b> 4 extra skill points at 1st level and 1 extra skill point at each additional level. 1 extra feat at 1st level.</p>
<p><b>Skill Bonus
</b> 4 extra skill points at 1st level and 1 extra skill point at each additional level.</p>
<p><b>Sneak Attack
</b> You can do an additional 2d6 damage if your opponent is unable to defend against you - whenever your opponent would be denied any dex bonus to AC, or you are flanking. Even at range (up to 30&#39;). Creatures immune to critical hits are also immune to this sneak bonus. This damage can be non-lethal only if you use a sap (blackjack) or unarmed attack</p>
<p><b>Sneak Attack
</b> +2d6</p>
<p><b>Track
</b> A ranger gains Track (see page 101) as a bonus feat.</p>
<p><b>Trapfinding
</b> Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. A rogue who beats a trap&#39;s DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.</p>
<p><b>Trap Sense
</b> Character has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.</p>
<p><b>Wild Empathy
 (Ex)
</b> A ranger can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a bear or a monitor lizard). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see page 72). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. to use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (such as a basilisk or a girallon), but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
