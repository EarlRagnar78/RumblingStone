    <div class="quote">
        "In the breaking dawn, I cast both light and shadow. My path walks between Lathander's radiance and Mask's
        mysteries, for in duality lies true power."
    </div>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="two-column">
        <p>The Lord of Sun and Shadow represents a rare spiritual awakening among those who channel eldritch power.
            These warlocks have discovered that true power comes not from darkness alone, but from embracing both the
            brilliant dawn of Lathander and the mysterious shadows of Mask. Their magic blends divine radiance with
            shadowy intrigue, creating a unique fusion that allows them to walk between worlds.</p>

        <p>Most warlocks are drawn to darker powers, making the Lord of Sun and Shadow an anomaly. Their journey begins
            when they experience a transformative vision—often during dawn or dusk—where both Lathander and Mask reveal
            complementary truths about the universe. They learn that light defines shadow, and shadow accentuates light;
            one cannot exist without the other.</p>

        <p>These enlightened warlocks channel their eldritch power through this philosophical duality. Their invocations
            take on aspects of both divine radiance and shadowy stealth. Their presence can be as blinding as the
            morning sun or as subtle as a thief in the night, depending on the need of the moment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="requirements">
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        To qualify to become a Lord of Sun and Shadow, a character must fulfill the following criteria:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Chaotic Good</li>
            <li><strong>Class:</strong> Warlock 5+</li>
            <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Knowledge (arcana) 8 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 8 ranks</li>
            <li><strong>Invocations:</strong> Must know at least one dark invocation</li>
            <li><strong>Special:</strong> Must have performed a special ritual at dawn while wearing or carrying a
                symbol of Lathander, and another ritual at dusk while wearing or carrying a symbol of Mask. These
                rituals require spending at least 500 gp in offerings to each deity.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="balance-note">
        <h3>Alignment Change Consequences</h3>
        <p><strong>Lost Powers:</strong> When a warlock changes alignment to Chaotic Good to take this class, they lose
            access to any Evil-aligned invocations (such as <em>curse of despair</em>, <em>wall of perilous flame</em>,
            or <em>dark discorporation</em>). They also lose 1 invocation known of their choice.</p>

        <p><strong>Gained Powers:</strong> They gain resistance to negative energy equal to their Charisma modifier, and
            can select from an expanded invocation list that includes Good-aligned options when they gain new
            invocations.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Class Information</h2>
    <p><span class="hit-die">Hit Die:</span> d8</p>

    <h3>Class Skills</h3>
    <p>The Lord of Sun and Shadow's class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are: Bluff (Cha), Concentration
        (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge
        (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Move
        Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Tumble (Dex), Use
        Magic Device (Cha).</p>

    <p><strong>Skill Points at Each Level:</strong> 4 + Int modifier</p>

    <h2>Class Features</h2>

    <h3>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h3>
    <p>Lords of Sun and Shadow gain no additional weapon proficiencies, but they do gain proficiency with light armor if
        they don't already have it.</p>

    <h3><span class="ability-name">Light Armor Mastery</span> <span class="ability-type">(Ex)</span></h3>
    <p>At 1st level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow can cast the divine spells granted by this class while wearing light armor
        without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. (They already ignore spell failure for invocations in
        light armor as per their warlock training).</p>

    <h3><span class="ability-name">Twilight Blast</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 1st level, your Lord of Sun and Shadow levels stack with your warlock levels for the purpose of determining
        your <strong>eldritch blast damage</strong>. In addition, your class levels stack with your warlock levels for
        the purpose of determining the value of your <strong>damage reduction</strong> (though the type remains Cold
        Iron unless changed by another ability).</p>

    <p>Furthermore, your eldritch blast undergoes a fundamental transformation. The blast becomes a swirling fusion of
        divine radiance and shadow essence. The damage type becomes mixed: half the damage is divine damage (as per
        <em>flame strike</em> spell), while the other half becomes fire damage. This mixed damage type bypasses most
        resistances, though creatures with specific divine damage resistances may apply them to the divine portion.
    </p>

    <div class="balance-note">
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A 7th level Lord of Sun and Shadow (Warlock 5/Lord 2) counts as a 7th-level warlock
            for damage, dealing 4d6 eldritch blast damage. On a roll of 18 total damage, 9 points would be divine damage
            and 9 points would be fire damage.</p>
    </div>

    <h3><span class="ability-name">Shadow's Secrets</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 2nd level, the Lord gains the ability to hear secrets carried on shadow. Once per day per class level, as a
        standard action, you can gain insight about a creature you can see within 60 feet. Make a Sense Motive check (DC
        15 + target's HD). Success reveals one of the following (your choice): the target's current hit points, one
        saving throw bonus, one special ability, or their general emotional state and primary motivation. This is a
        divination effect.</p>

    <h3><span class="ability-name">Blessing of the Morning Lord</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 3rd level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow gains resistance to negative energy equal to their class level + their
        Charisma modifier. Additionally, they gain a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws against death effects, energy
        drain, and necromancy spells or effects.</p>

    <h3><span class="ability-name">Shadow's Guidance</span> <span class="ability-type">(Ex)</span></h3>
    <p>At 4th level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow becomes more adept at stealth and deception under Mask's guidance. They
        gain a +2 competence bonus to Hide, Move Silently, Bluff, and Sleight of Hand checks. These bonuses increase by
        +1 for every two additional Lord of Sun and Shadow levels beyond 4th (to a maximum of +5 at 10th level).</p>

    <h3><span class="ability-name">Enhanced Twilight Blast</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 5th level, your Twilight Blast becomes more potent. Choose one of the following enhancements when you attain
        5th level:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Solar Ray:</strong> Your eldritch blast dazzles targets for 1 round on a failed Fortitude save (DC
            10 + half your class level + Charisma modifier). Against undead, this effect also deals +1d6 additional
            divine damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Shadow Veil:</strong> Your eldritch blast creates wisps of shadow around the target. On a failed
            Will save (same DC), the target suffers a -1 penalty to AC and attack rolls for 1 round.</li>
        <li><strong>Twilight Mark:</strong> Your eldritch blast marks the target with twilight energy. For 1 round after
            being struck, the target takes 1 extra point of damage from any divine or fire damage sources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><span class="ability-name">Dawn's Revelation</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 5th level, once per day, a Lord of Sun and Shadow can invoke the revealing light of dawn as a standard action.
        This creates bright light in a 30-foot radius centered on you for 1 round per class level. Within this light,
        invisible creatures become visible (as <em>see invisibility</em>), and illusions of 3rd level or lower are
        automatically dispelled. Creatures attempting Stealth checks take a -10 penalty.</p>

    <h3><span class="ability-name">Twilight Invocation</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 6th level, once per day, when using any warlock invocation that deals damage, you can enhance it with twilight
        energy. The invocation's damage becomes half divine, half fire (like your Twilight Blast), and the save DC
        increases by +1. At 9th level, this ability can be used twice per day.</p>

    <div class="balance-note">
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using <em>eldritch spear</em> enhanced with Twilight Invocation would change its
            normal eldritch blast damage to half divine/half fire damage with a +1 DC bonus to any applicable saves.</p>
    </div>

    <h3><span class="ability-name">Shroud of Shadows</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 7th level, three times per day as a swift action, a Lord of Sun and Shadow can wrap themselves in protective
        shadows for 1 round per class level. This grants concealment (20% miss chance) and a +4 circumstance bonus to
        Hide checks. The effect ends if you attack or use a targeted invocation.</p>

    <h3><span class="ability-name">Solar Flare</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 8th level, once per day as a full-round action, a Lord of Sun and Shadow can create a burst of brilliant
        sunlight. This affects a 15-foot radius centered on you. Creatures in the area take 3d6 points of divine damage
        and 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex save for half damage, DC 10 + class level + Charisma modifier). Undead
        creatures take an additional 2d6 divine damage. You are immune to your own Solar Flare.</p>

    <h3><span class="ability-name">Shadow's Embrace</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 9th level, once per day, a Lord of Sun and Shadow can become semi-incorporeal for up to 3 rounds. As a
        standard action, you gain the incorporeal subtype, allowing you to pass through solid objects and gain a 50%
        miss chance against nonmagical attacks. You can still cast spells and use invocations while semi-incorporeal,
        but physical attacks deal only half damage.</p>

    <h3><span class="ability-name">Avatar of Twilight</span> <span class="ability-type">(Su)</span></h3>
    <p>At 10th level, once per day as a swift action, you can transform into an Avatar of Twilight for 5 rounds. While
        in this form, you gain the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Twilight Blast damage increases by 1d6</li>
        <li>You can use Shadow's Secrets as a move action</li>
        <li>You gain damage reduction 5/evil</li>
        <li>You gain immunity to blindness and dazzling effects</li>
        <li>Your movement speed increases by 20 feet</li>
        <li>You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your Charisma score</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Invocations</h3>
    <p>At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 8th, 9th, and 10th level, you gain new invocations known and an increase in caster level
        as if you had also gained a level in the warlock class. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character
        of that class would have gained.</p>

    <h3>Spells</h3>
    <p>Beginning at 2nd level, a Lord of Sun and Shadow gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. To
        cast a spell, you must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level. Saving throws against these
        spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + your Charisma modifier. You cast spells as a favored soul of your Lord of
        Sun and Shadow level.</p>

    <p><strong>Spells Known:</strong> You learn spells according to the progression shown in the class table. When you
        gain access to a new spell level, you automatically learn one spell of that level from the Lord of Sun and
        Shadow spell list. At subsequent levels, you may learn additional spells as shown on the table.</p>

    <h2>Playing a Lord of Sun and Shadow</h2>

    <p><strong>Combat:</strong> In battle, you are versatile and adaptive. Use your enhanced eldritch blast to deal
        consistent damage while utilizing stealth abilities to position yourself advantageously. Your divine magic
        provides healing and protection for allies, while your shadow abilities offer tactical advantages through
        concealment and information gathering.</p>

    <p><strong>Advancement:</strong> Focus on enhancing your Charisma to improve both your invocations and divine
        spellcasting. Prioritize skills like Hide, Move Silently, Knowledge (Religion), and Spellcraft. Valuable feats
        include Ability Focus (Eldritch Blast), Extra Invocation, Spell Penetration, and Point Blank Shot.</p>

    <p><strong>Resources:</strong> Lords of Sun and Shadow are rare, making formal organizations scarce. Temples of
        Lathander may provide healing and guidance for your divine aspects, while secretive followers of Mask can offer
        information and training in stealth arts. Balance your allegiances carefully, as extremists from either faith
        may view your dual devotion with suspicion.</p>

    <h2>Compatibility with Ring of Chaotic Illumination</h2>
    <div class="balance-note">
        <p>The Ring of Chaotic Illumination's Shadow Step ability (60 ft range, every 5 rounds) is more powerful than
            any teleportation ability in this class. The class focuses on stealth enhancement, information gathering,
            and mixed damage types rather than teleportation, avoiding overlap. The ring's enhanced vision and wings
            provide utility the class lacks, making them complementary rather than redundant.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Lore</h2>

    <div class="quote">
        "I watched her emerge from the shadows at dawn, hands glowing with divine fire. The undead horde withered before
        her like morning mist before the sun. In that moment, I understood that light and shadow are not opposed—they
        are complementary forces in the hands of those wise enough to see beyond dualism."<br>
        —Eldrin Mostana, High Priest of Lathander
    </div>

    <p>Lords of Sun and Shadow often serve as mediators and diplomats, their understanding of duality making them
        natural peacemakers. They excel as investigators and information gatherers, using both divine insight and
        shadowy techniques to uncover truth. Many become specialized hunters of undead and aberrations, their mixed
        divine and shadow magic proving particularly effective against such creatures.</p>

    <p>Legend speaks of the first Lord of Sun and Shadow, a warlock named Miraleth who experienced simultaneous visions
        of both Lathander and Mask during a solar eclipse. Both deities are said to have appeared to her, not as rivals,
        but as complementary aspects of a greater cosmic truth. This dual revelation transformed her understanding of
        magic and morality, leading to the creation of this unique path.</p>
