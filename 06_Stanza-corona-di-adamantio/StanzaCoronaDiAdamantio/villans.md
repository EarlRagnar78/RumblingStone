An epic confrontation awaits a party of four 13th-level adventurers with this enhanced cadre of villains. The yochlols have been twisted by illithid influence into psionic abominations, while the dwarf Belkram and his loyal worg have been driven to madness by drow corruption, making them significantly more dangerous. This encounter is designed to be a severe challenge, likely an Encounter Level (EL) of 17, and will test the party's tactics, resourcefulness, and resilience.

### Corrupted Fiendish Dire Worg CR 10

Belkram's worg has been similarly twisted, its form bloated and warped. Its fur is patchy, revealing sickly, pulsating flesh beneath, and its eyes glow with a malevolent green light. It moves with an unsettling, twitching gait, constantly snarling and dripping a viscous, black saliva.
