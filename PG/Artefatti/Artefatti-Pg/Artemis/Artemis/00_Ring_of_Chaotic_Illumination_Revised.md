## Physical Description
The ring appears as a circle of obsidian pulsing with an inner violet light. Following the bearer's interaction with the **Eternal Forge** and their rejection of the *Lord of Sun and Shadow* path to forge their own destiny, the ring has physically changed.
*   **Gold Veins:** Thin veins of Lathander's gold now run through the black stone.
*   **Silver Glyphs:** Mask's silver sigils shift and dance along the rim.
*   **Violet Core:** The warlock's chaotic essence binds them together.
When active, it projects a faint, harmonious hum—the sound of order (Forge) and chaos (Warlock) in perfect tension.

## History & Awakening
Originally forged during the Era of Torments, the ring was recently re-awakened in the **Hall of the Eternal Forge**. The bearer, Artemis, refused the easy path of a Prestige Class offered by the gods, choosing instead to rely on his own chaotic nature. Recognizing this resolve, the ring absorbed the essence of the **Mithral Column of Unity** and the **Dual Flames** of the Forge, evolving into a true artifact of balance.
