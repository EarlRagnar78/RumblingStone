<p><b>Animal Type
</b> </p>
<p><b>Animal Type
</b> Animals eat/sleep/breathe</p>
<p><b>Combat
</b> A heavy warhorse can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check.</p>
<p><b>Empathic Link
 (Su)
</b> The paladin has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The paladin cannot see through the mount&#39;s eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible. Because of this empathic link, the paladin has the same connection to an item or place that her mount does, just as with a master and his familiar (see Familiars, page 52).</p>
<p><b>Improved Evasion
 (Ex)
</b> When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.</p>
<p><b>Low-Light Vision
 (Ex)
</b> You can see 2x as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.</p>
<p><b>Scent
 (Ex)
</b> </p>
<p><b>Share Saving Throws
</b> For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the paladin&#39;s, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn&#39;t share any other bonuses on saves that the master might have (such as from magic items or feats).</p>
<p><b>Share Spells
</b> At the paladin&#39;s option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount. The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before the duration expires. Additionally, the paladin may cast a spell with a target of &quot;You&quot; on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A paladin and her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount&#39;s type (magical beast).</p>
