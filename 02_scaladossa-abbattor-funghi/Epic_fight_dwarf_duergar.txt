Tactical Overview:

    Initial Setup:
        The evil cleric casts Bless, Shield of Faith, and Protection from Good on himself and his allies before combat begins.
        The antipaladins use Corrupt Weapon and Bull's Strength to boost their damage.
        The duergar use Invisibility to set up ambushes and Mage Armor for defense.

    Combat Tactics:
        The cleric focuses on debuffing the party with Hold Person, Bestow Curse, and Greater Command while healing allies as needed.
        The antipaladins charge the front lines, using their smite and cleave abilities to deal significant damage to the fighter and monk/fighter.
        The duergar target the warlock and druid with Magic Missile, Fireball, and Displacement while using Sneak Attack whenever possible.

    Mid-Combat Adjustments:
        The cleric uses Harm and Flame Strike to deal heavy damage if the party starts gaining the upper hand.
        The antipaladins switch to defensive tactics using Lay on Hands and Inflict Wounds spells if their health drops.
        The duergar use Mirror Image and Web to control the battlefield and protect themselves from counterattacks.

Suggested Image for the Encounter:

For an encounter located deep underground on a platform made of bones and tendons, consider an image that evokes a dark, eerie, and foreboding atmosphere. Here are some ideas:

    Bones and Tendons Platform: Look for images that depict a grotesque, skeletal structure with fleshy tendons. The platform should appear unstable and macabre, emphasizing the evil nature of the setting.

    Underground Cavern: An image of a dark, cavernous space with eerie lighting, shadows, and bone structures. This can give the sense of being deep underground in a place that is both ancient and sinister.

    Dark Ritual Area: Images of a dark ritual site with symbols, bones, and perhaps some glowing, magical elements that highlight the presence of evil forces at work.
