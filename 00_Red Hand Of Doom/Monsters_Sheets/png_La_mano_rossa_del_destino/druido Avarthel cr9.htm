</b> +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks: Half-elves get along naturally with all people.</p>
<p><b>Animal Companion
</b> </p>
<p><b>Animal Companion
 (Ex)
</b> A druid may begin play with an animal companion. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>
<p><b>Elven Blood
</b> For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered an elf. Half-elves, for example, are just as vulnerable to special effects that affect elves as their elf ancestors are, and they can use magic items that are only usable by elves.</p>
<p><b>Half-Elf Racial Traits
 (Ex)
</b> <p>Immunity to sleep spells and similar magical effects, and a +2 racial bonus on saving throw against enchantment spells or effects. </p>
<p>Low-light Vision: A half-elf can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions. </p>
<p>+1 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks: A half-elf does not have the elf&#39;s ability to notice secret doors simply by passing near them. Half-elves have keen senses, but not as keen as those of an elf. </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks: Half-elves get along naturally with all people. </p>
<p>Elven Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered an elf. Half-elves, for example, are just as vulnerable to special effects that affect elves as their elf ancestors are, and they can use magic items that are only usable by elves.</p></p>
<p><b>Humanoid Type
</b> </p>
<p><b>Low-Light Vision
 (Ex)
</b> You can see 2x as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.</p>
<p><b>Nature Sense
 (Ex)
</b> A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.</p>
<p><b>Spells
</b> A druid casts divine spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>
<p><b>Spontaneous Casting
</b> A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn&#39;t prepared ahead of time. She can &quot;lose&quot; a prepared spell in order to cast any summon nature&#39;s ally spell of the same level or lower. For example, a druid who has prepared repel vermin (a 4th-level spell) may lose repel vermin in order to cast summon nature&#39;s ally IV (also a 4th-level spell).</p>
<p><b>Spontaneous Curing
 (Su)
</b> You can spontaneously convert prepared druid spells of 1st level or higher into cure light wounds spells, just as a cleric can. This does not extend to higher level level cure spells. This replaces the Resist Nature&#39;s Lure class ability.</p>
<p><b>Trackless Step
 (Ex)
</b> Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>
<p><b>Venom Immunity
 (Ex)
</b> At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Druids are proficient with various weapons and with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones. A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spelllike class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>
<p><b>Wild Empathy
 (Ex)
</b> A druid can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a bear or a monitor lizard). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4: Skills). The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. to use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (such as a basilisk or a girallon), but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.</p>
<p><b>Wild Empathy
</b> </p>
<p><b>Wild Shape
 (Su)
</b> a druid has the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn&#39;t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with. A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. The new form&#39;s Hit Dice can&#39;t exceed the character&#39;s druid level. 3/day for 9 hours (Small, Medium or Large)</p>
<p><b>Wild Shape ~ Animal (Large)
</b> </p>
<p><b>Wild Shape ~ Animal (Medium)
</b> </p>
<p><b>Wild Shape ~ Animal (Small)
</b> </p>
<p><b>Wild Shape (Humanoid)
 (Su)
</b> You can use your wild shape ability to assume a Medium humanoid form. You can resemble a human, dwarf, elf, or other medium humanoid as you desire. This locks out 1 use/day of your wild shape.</p>
<p><b>Woodland Stride
 (Ex)
</b> Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.</p>
