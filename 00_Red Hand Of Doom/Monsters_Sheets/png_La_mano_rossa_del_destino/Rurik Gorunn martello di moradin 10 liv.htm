<p><b>Associates
</b> While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.</p>
<p><b>Aura of Courage
 (Su)
</b> Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.</p>
<p><b>Aura of Good
 (Ex)
</b> The power of a paladin&#39;s aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to her paladin level, just like the aura of a cleric of a good deity.</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Hammers of Moradin are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields. Armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble, and double the normal armor check penalty applies to Swim checks.</p>
<p><b>Aura of Courage
 (Su)
</b> Beginning at 1st level, the hammer of Moradin gains an aura of courage that functions like the paladin ability of the same name.</p>
<p><b>Hammer Throw
 (Ex)
</b> A hammer of Moradin may use his warhammer as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 20 feet. He takes no additional penalties for using the weapon in this fashion.</p>
<p><b>Goblinkiller
 (Su)
</b> Beginning at 2nd level, the hammer of Moradin may imbue any warhammer with the goblinoid bane property as a move action. This ability may be used once per day, and the effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the hammer of Moradin&#39;s Charisma modifier.</p>
<p><b>Hammer Return
 (Su)
</b> When the hammer of Moradin reaches 2nd level, any warhammer he throws gains the returning special ability. A returning warhammer flies through the air back to the hammer of Moradin, returning just before his next turn, so that it is ready to use again in that turn. Catching the warhammer when it comes back is a free action. If the hammer of Moradin can&#39;t catch it, or if he has moved since throwing it, the warhammer drops to the ground in the square from which it was thrown.</p>
<p><b>Code of Conduct
</b> A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin&#39;s code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.</p>
<p><b>Darkvision
 (Ex)
</b> Range 60 ft.; Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.</p>
<p><b>Detect Evil
 (Sp)
</b> At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell. 60&#39; cone. 1st Round - Presence of evil, 2nd round - Number of Evil auras, and the power of the most potent, 3rd Round - Power and location of each aura, with direction but not location if out of line of sight.</p>
<p><b>Divine Grace
 (Su)
</b> At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.</p>
<p><b>Divine Health
 (Ex)
</b> At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases (such as mummy rot and lycanthropy).</p>
<p><b>Dwarf Racial Traits
 (Ex)
</b> <p>Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet with Darkvision. </p>
<p>Dwarves treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons. </p>
<p>Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn&#39;t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. </p>
<p>Stability: +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing firmly on the ground. </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects </p>
<p>+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids </p>
<p>+4 Dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items. </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.</p></p>
<p><b>Humanoid Type
</b> </p>
<p><b>Lay on Hands
 (Su)
</b> Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level * her Charisma bonus. For example, a 7th-level paladin with a 16 Charisma (+3 bonus) can heal 21 points of damage per day. A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn&#39;t have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action. Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn&#39;t provoke an attack of opportunity. The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.</p>
<p><b>Remove Disease
 (Sp)
</b> At 6th level, a paladin can produce a remove disease effect, as the spell, once per week. She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth) (PH 271).</p>
<p><b>Smite Evil
 (Su)
</b> Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. For example, a 13th-level paladin armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+13 points of damage, plus any additional bonuses for high Strength or magical affects that would normally apply. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day. At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table 3-12: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.</p>
<p><b>Special Mount
 (Sp)
</b> a paladin gains the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade. Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the celestial realms in which it resides. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed (including barding, saddle, saddlebags, and the like). Should the paladin&#39;s mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying.</p>
<p><b>Special Mount
</b> </p>
<p><b>Turn Undead
 (Su)
</b> A paladin has the supernatural ability to turn undead. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. You turn undead as a cleric of three levels lower would. (PH p.159.)</p>
<p><b>Turn Undead
</b> 5/day (turn level 5) (turn damage 2d6+7)</p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
