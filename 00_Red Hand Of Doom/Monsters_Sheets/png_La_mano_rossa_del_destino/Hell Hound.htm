<hr />
<p><b>Breath Weapon
 (Su)
</b> 10-foot cone, once every 2d4 rounds, damage 2d6 fire, Reflex DC 14 half. The save DC is Constitution-based.</p>
<p><b>Darkvision
 (Ex)
</b> Range 60 ft.; Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.</p>
<p><b>Dragonblood Subtype
</b> </p>
<p><b>Dragonblood Subtype
</b> If a race possesses the dragonblood subtype, it has a strong affinity to dragons-which means that spells, effects, powers, and abilities that affect or target dragons also affect it. The subtype qualifies a creature to use magic items normally only usable by dragons, and qualifies the creature to take feats that have the subtype as a prerequisite. The dragonblood subtype also makes creatures subject to harmful effects that affect dragons. The dragonblood subtype does not confer the dragon type or any traits associated with that type. For instance, it does not give a creature frightful presence. Dragons automatically qualify for any classes, prestige classes, racial substitution levels, feats, powers, or spells that require the dragonblood subtype. Races presented in this book that have the dragonblood subtype include dragonborn, spellscale, kobold, and draconic creatures. Should a creature acquire the dragon type, it loses the dragonblood subtype.</p>
<p><b>Evil Subtype
</b> </p>
<p><b>Evil Subtype
</b> A creature with the evil subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were evil-aligned</p>
<p><b>Extraplanar Subtype
</b> </p>
<p><b>Extraplanar Subtype
</b> A subtype applied to any creature when it is on a plane other than its native plane. A creature that travels the planes can gain or lose this subtype as it goes from plane to plane. Monster entries assume that encounters with creatures take place on the Material Plane, and every creature whose native plane is not the Material Plane has the extraplanar subtype (but would not have when on its home plane). Every extraplanar creature in this book has a home plane mentioned in its description. Creatures not labeled as extraplanar are natives of the Material Plane, and they gain the extraplanar subtype if they leave the Material Plane. No creature has the extraplanar subtype when it is on a transitive plane, such as the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and the Plane of Shadow.</p>
<p><b>Fiery Bite
 (Su)
</b> A hell hound deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage every time it bites an opponent, as if its bite were a flaming weapon.</p>
<p><b>Fire Subtype
</b> </p>
<p><b>Fire Subtype
</b> A creature with the fire subtype has immunity to fire. It has vulnerability to cold, which means it takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure.</p>
<p><b>Immunity to Fire
 (Ex)
</b> You never take Fire damage</p>
<p><b>Lawful Subtype
</b> </p>
<p><b>Lawful Subtype
</b> A creature with the lawful subtype overcomes damage reduction as if its natural weapons and any weapons it wields were lawful-aligned</p>
<p><b>Low-Light Vision
 (Ex)
</b> You can see 2x as far as humans in low illumination. Characters with low-light vision have eyes that are so sensitive to light that they can see twice as far as normal in dim light. Low-light vision is color vision. A spellcaster with low-light vision can read a scroll as long as even the tiniest candle flame is next to her as a source of light. Characters with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day.</p>
<p><b>Outsider Type
</b> </p>
<p><b>Outsider Type
</b> Outsiders breathe but do not sleep/eat (though they can if they wish). Outsiders&#39; souls and bodies are one unit so cannot be restored to life by spells that restore souls to a body (requires a different effect such as a Wish or True Resurrection).</p>
<p><b>Saves
</b> Draconic creatures have a +4 racial bonus on saves against magic sleep effects and paralysis.</p>
<p><b>Skills
</b> Hell hounds have a +5 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks. *They also receive a +8 racial bonus on Survival checks when tracking by scent, due to their keen sense of smell.</p>
<p><b>Vulnerability to Cold
 (Ex)
</b> You take half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from Cold, regardless of whether a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or failure</p>
