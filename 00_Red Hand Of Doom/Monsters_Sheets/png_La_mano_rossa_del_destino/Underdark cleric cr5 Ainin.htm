<p><b>Aura
</b> A cleric has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity&#39;s alignment</p>
<p><b>Aura of Good
 (Ex)
</b> Strong</p>
<p><b>Aura of Law
 (Ex)
</b> Strong</p>
<p><b>Darkvision
 (Ex)
</b> Range 60 ft.; Darkvision is the extraordinary ability to see with no light source at all, out to a range specified for the creature. Darkvision is black and white only (colors cannot be discerned). It does not allow characters to see anything that they could not see otherwise-invisible objects are still invisible, and illusions are still visible as what they seem to be. Likewise, darkvision subjects a creature to gaze attacks normally. The presence of light does not spoil darkvision.</p>
<p><b>Dwarf Racial Traits
 (Ex)
</b> <p>Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet with Darkvision. </p>
<p>Dwarves treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons. </p>
<p>Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn&#39;t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up. </p>
<p>Stability: +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing firmly on the ground. </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects </p>
<p>+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids </p>
<p>+4 Dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items. </p>
<p>+2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.</p></p>
<p><b>Hammer Specialist
 (Ex)
</b> A dwarf cleric&#39;s dedication to the forge-god results in exceptional skill with the warhammer. A dwarf cleric who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level gains the Martial Weapon Proficiency (warhammer) feat (if she doesn&#39;t already have it). She also gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when wielding a warhammer in melee. This racial substitution level is only available to dwarf clerics who follow Moradin (or any other deity whose favored weapon is a warhammer). This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 4th level. From now on, the cleric can prepare one fewer 2nd-level cleric spell than indicated on Table 3-6, page 31 of the Player&#39;s Handbook.</p>
<p><b>Humanoid Type
</b> </p>
<p><b>Smite Giants
 (Su)
</b> A dwarf cleric who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level can attempt to smite a giant with a melee attack, similar to the way a paladin smites an evil creature. She adds her Constitution bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per cleric level. The cleric can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Con modifier (minimum once per day). If the cleric accidentally smites a creature that is not a giant, the smite has no effect but still counts as one of the cleric&#39;s daily smite attempts. This substitution benefit replaces the standard cleric&#39;s ability to turn or rebuke undead.</p>
<p><b>Spells
</b> A cleric casts divine spells. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains. Clerics do not acquire their spells from books or scrolls, nor do they prepare them through study. Instead, they meditate or pray for their spells, receiving them through their own strength of faith or as divine inspiration. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells, and decide which ones to choose for that day. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells.</p>
<p><b>Spontaneous Casting
</b> </p>
<p><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency
</b> Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
